#BearTheConsequences
===================

##Garry's Mod Open Source Project

###How do you play this?
Murder style game where one player is a bear and the other players try bear with the consequences of having a bear around.

###What to do as a bear?
Bear should be able to maul people and have a sprint

###What to do as a human?
Try to survive the bear attack for the time given maybe? Kill the bear with traps? Get pieces of a weapon scrambled around the map to have a chance to fight against the bear? Or if you're manly enough go 1on1 vs the bear using the crowbar.
